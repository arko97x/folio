                    <span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>
                        This was my first ever freelance project, that I undertook back in 2019. <br />
                        The project is a brainchild of the following wonderful folks: Sarthak Kejriwal, Udit Dey,
                        Sanidhya Bajoria & Shiv Kapoor. <br />
                        I was tasked with designing the logo, app UI and also the flow within the app.
                        I find myself unable to share the UI prototypes (yet), as the app is yet to hit
                        the App/Play Stores. However, I'll take you through the logo design process.

                        <b>InFlo</b> was being built to be a platform of sorts. <br />The idea was to
                        come up with a logomark that would incorporate a feel of <b>"flow
                        of information"</b>. A logomark, by definition, <i>is a symbol which
                        represents a brand, and usually does not include the name of that company</i>.
                    </span>
                    <br /><br />
                    <span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>
                        The first concept was too abstract and wasn't able to capture the essence
                        of <b>InFlo</b> and what it represented as a product. I was more inclined
                        towards exploring and refining the second concept. Sarthak &
                        the rest of the team were on the same page, w.r.t this.

                    <hr style={{ borderColor: "#707070" }} />
                    <br />

                        REFINEMENT
                    </span> <br /> <br />
                    <span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>
                        In this phase, I moved the sketches over to the computer and employed the
                        services of <i>Inkscape</i>, a pretty potent tool, if you ask me.
                        <br /><br />
                        I began by digitally recreating the basic structure of the logomark;
                        used a grid to aid me in the process. Then came the brand colors.
                        And VOILA!
